     <h3>TCWC 2.0 — A National-Scale Creative Movement</h3>
  <p>
    I’m co-leading <strong>The Clean Water Challenge 2.0</strong>, a 45-day pan-India campaign blending 
    <em>art, poetry, and advocacy</em> to spotlight India’s water crisis. Hosted by 
    <a href="https://oceanfdn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      <strong>The Ocean Cleanup</strong>
    </a> and 
    <a href="https://bharatcleanrivers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      <strong>Bharat Clean Rivers Foundation</strong>
    </a>, and in partnership with AIESEC India, this movement goes beyond awareness — it's about 
    storytelling with impact
  </p>
  <p>
    From crafting its creative voice — visuals, reels, and campaign messaging — to shaping outreach strategies, 
    I'm helping TCWC 2.0 speak not through statistics, but through emotion and narrative. It's more than an event, it's a cultural movement designed to move hearts and inspire change
